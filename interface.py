# The file interface.py contains the code for the GUI.
# Design and implement a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) to visualize your results
# You can imagine that through it you can choose the database schema (TPC-H in this case), specify the query in the
# Query panel and upon execution of your algorithm the Query panel is updated with annotations. You may also selectively
# visualize the corresponding QEP in another panel.
